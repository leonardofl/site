<section>
<p>We are approaching our research about “how to organize teams and departments for managing infrastructure in the context of continuous delivery” by interviewing industry professionals working with products delivered by a continuous delivery flow.</p>

<p>Our interviews follow this protocol:</p>

<ul>
<li>We pose a series of questions to be freely answered by the interviewed.</li>
<li>The focus is on the recent experience of the interviewed. </li>
<li>We expect the interview to take from 40 to 60 minutes.</li>
<li>If the interview is online, we prefer to chat by video.</li>
<li>The interview is recorded for after-analysis.</li>
<li>We will keep the record under secrecy.</li>
<li>The interview analysis will be conducted by our research team: Leonardo Leite (Ph.D. student at USP), prof. Fabio Kon (USP), and prof. Paulo Meirelles (Unifesp).</li>
<li>We will send the research results to the interviewed people.</li>
<li>The publication, originated from interviews, will anonymize interviewed people and their organizations.</li>
</ul>
